# 1000v1000_battle
A simple battle simulator pitting two sides against each other

Use the HTML file and a fresh page load to simulate a battle of 1000 vs 1000. 
The JS file contains all the code that makes it work. 
Took me a good three tries to get this working as good as it is now, but there's room for improvement. 

Hopefully someone builds a bigger better game off this engine!
